<u><h2>Instructions</h2></u>

<ol>
    <h3>Prepare the Crispy Noodles</h3>
    <li>If you are using fresh egg noodles, separate them into individual portions. If using dried egg noodles, cook them according to the package instructions until they are slightly undercooked (al dente). Drain and set aside.</li>
    
    <h3>Fry the Noodles</h3>
    <li>Heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a deep skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot (around 350°F or 175°C), add the noodles one portion at a time. Fry each portion until they turn golden brown and crispy, which should take about 1-2 minutes per side. Remove the crispy noodles and drain them on paper towels. Set aside.</li>
    
    <h3>Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <li>In a separate bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in water to make a slurry. Set aside.</li>

    <li>Add the julienned carrot, red bell pepper, broccoli, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and baby corn (if using). Stir-fry for about 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are slightly tender but still crisp.</li>

    <li>Add the chicken or vegetable broth and stir well.</li>
