<u><h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Instructions</h2></u>

<ol>
    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">Wash and scrub the potatoes thoroughly to remove any dirt.</li>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">Leave the potato skins on for added flavor and texture or peel them if you prefer.</li>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">Using a mandoline slicer or a sharp knife, slice the potatoes into very thin, even rounds. Aim for thickness between 1/16 to 1/8 inch (1.5 to 3 mm). Be careful while using the mandoline, and watch your fingers.</li>
    
    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Rinse and Soak</h3>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">Place the potato slices in a large bowl of cold water. This will help remove excess starch and prevent the chips from sticking together during frying. Soak the slices for about 15-30 minutes, changing the water once or twice.</li>
    
    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Dry the Slices</h3>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">Drain the potato slices and pat them completely dry using paper towels. Removing excess moisture is essential for achieving crispy chips.</li>
    
    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Heat the Oil</h3>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">Fill a deep, heavy-bottomed pot or a deep fryer with about 2-3 inches of vegetable oil. Heat the oil to 350-375째F (175-190째C) using a deep-fry thermometer to monitor the temperature. It's important to maintain the correct oil temperature for crispy chips.</li>
    
    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Fry the Potato Chips</h3>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">Carefully add a small batch of potato slices to the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the pot; fry them in batches for even cooking.
    Fry the chips for about 2-3 minutes or until they turn golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove them from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet to drain excess oil.</li>
    
    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Season and Cool</h3>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">While the chips are still hot, season them with salt and any optional seasonings you prefer, such as paprika, garlic powder, or cayenne pepper. Toss or sprinkle the seasonings evenly over the chips.</li>

    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Repeat</h3>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">Continue frying the remaining potato slices in batches until you've made all your chips. Remember to maintain the oil temperature between 350-375째F (175-190째C).</li>

    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Serve</h3>
    <li style="font-size: 20px;">    Allow the homemade potato chips to cool for a few minutes to let them crisp up fully. Then, serve them immediately as a snack or side dish.
    <br>
    Enjoy your homemade potato chips! They're best when fresh and crispy.</li>
